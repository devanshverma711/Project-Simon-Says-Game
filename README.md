# Project-Simon-Says-Game

In this code, I've created a simple Simon Says game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you click the "Start Game" button, the game begins, and Simon will generate a random sequence of colors that the player must mimic. Players click the colored buttons to match Simon's pattern, and the game keeps track of the player's progress. If the player makes a mistake, the game will end, and they can restart by clicking "Start Game" again.
